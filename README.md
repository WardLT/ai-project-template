# AI Project Template

A template for organizing projects that use AI to solve scientific problems.
The organization is designed with a few goals in mind:

1. *Reproducibility*: Ensure that all work towards a project is easy to capture.
1. *Development Best Practices*: Make it easy to develop complex code using established tools and practices
1. *Teamwork*: Create good entry points for others to join your project
1. *Publication*: Minimal effort should be required to archive the project
1. *Efficiency*: None of the above goals should interfere with executing the science
